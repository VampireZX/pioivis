\section{\normalsize I\small NTRODUCTION}

\small {At present the researches in the field of creation
of intelligent models are actively conducted. The main
tendencies of their development are the following:\par
\begin{itemize}
    \item these intelligent models are actively used for the
solution of poorly structured and unstructured problems;
    \item these intelligent models based on representation and
processing of heterogeneous data and knowledge;
    \item principles of hybridization and adaptability are used
more and more widely;
    \item problems can be solved in conditions of various types of uncertainty (stochastic, statistical, not
stochastic, linguistic).
\end{itemize}

At present intensive researches are carried out in the
field of the following intelligent modelling [1]: fuzzy
models based on theories of fuzzy computing, fuzzy sets
and relations, fuzzy measure, fuzzy logic and inference;
neural networks models based on artificial neural network theory; methods and technologies of evolutional
modelling and genetic algorithms.

\par For each intelligent model is possible to define the
development trends.

\par The development trends of fuzzy models are the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item development of fuzzy mathematics (of fuzzy computing, fuzzy sets and relations, fuzzy measure,
fuzzy logic etc.);
    \item designing of fuzziness into traditional mathematical
models;
    \item designing of fuzzy models which correspond to
features of tasks;
    \item hybridization of fuzzy models of various types;
 \item use of fuzzy models, methods and technologies for
problem solving in various subject areas.
\end{itemize}

The development trends of neural networks models are
the following:\\
\begin{itemize}

    \item designing of neuron-like elements of artificial neural
networks; 

    \item designing of neural networks which correspond to
the features of tasks;

    \item designing of algorithms of artificial neural networks
training;

    \item combination of neural networks models of various
types;

    \item use of neural networks models, methods and technologies for solving problems in various subject
areas

\end{itemize}

The development trends of evolutionary modelling
methods and technologies are the following:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item designing of genetic operators, criteria and search
strategy;

    \item designing of genetic algorithms providing the
greater accuracy and rapid convergence;

    \item developing of approaches to adaptation of genetic
algorithms for problem solving in various subject
areas.
\end{itemize}

At present the intensive researches are conducted in
the field of creation of hybrid intelligent models, methods and technologies. Hybridization of these intelligent
models allows them to complement each other.

Hybridization compensates the restrictions of each of
these models and it also provides tolerance to uncertainty
and partial validity of the data used to achieve flexibility
of decisions [2].

However, up to now, there is no unified approach
to hybrid models systematization. The purpose of this
paper is the following: to systematize of existing hybrid
models; to develop a mechanism for hybridization of
intelligent models.}
\section{\normalsize HYBRIDIZATION METHOD OF
INTELLIGENT MODELS}
Hybridization can be realized in different ways: either
between models related to different intelligent technologies, or within the same intellectual technology [3]. In
both cases hybridization of intelligent models is possible
on the basis of one of following approaches:
\begin{itemize}
    \item hybridization “with functional replacement” – one
of the model is picked out as a dominating model,
and its separate components are replaced with components of other model;
    \item hybridization “with interaction” – several models
are used relatively independently, and thus they
solve various particular tasks in achieving the final
goal, exchanging data.
\end{itemize}

\par
Let’s briefly consider these approaches of hybridization, firstly, by the example of various intelligent technologies and, secondly, within the limits of a separate technology. Let’s demonstrate realization of the
hybridization approach “with functional replacement” on
the example of fuzzy models’ and neural networks. We
will consider fuzzy rule-based models as the dominant,
and we will design each separate component of these
models on the basis of neural networks. Possible ways of
such hybridization allow to distinguish a separate class of
fuzzy rule-based neural models (the first sign mentioned
– fuzzy – is dominant) [3-5].

In case the neural networks are used as dominating
models, then realization of separate components of these
models can be executed on the basis of fuzzy models’
components. Possible ways of such hybridization allow
distinguish a separate class of neural fuzzy models (the
first mentioned sign – neural – is dominating) [6].

Hybridization “with functional replacement” in the
context of separate technology is most peculiar to neural
networks technology (i.e. hybridization neural networks
models only).

Let’s demonstrate realization of the hybridization approach “with interaction” by the example of fuzzy models and neural networks technologies (to be more precise,
fuzzy rule-based models and neural networks as above).
According to this method the following models can be
offered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fuzzy rule-based models with use of neural networks for space partition of input variables and
formation multidimensional membership functions
of antecedents for them;
    \item joint using of fuzzy rule-based models and neural
networks for computing and “interchange” by parameter values [7].
\end{itemize}

The approach of hybridization of intelligent models
“with interaction” is the most important at performance
of complex problems. Complex problems are the problems that require the use of various models for performance of separate stages or particular tasks to achieve
general purpose.


Let’s consider the hybridization method “with interaction” within the limits of one technology by the example
of fuzzy models at realization of complex problems [3].
This method consists of the following stages.

\textit{Stage} 1. Decomposition of a complex problem into set
of particular tasks.


\begin{center}
$Problem = \{Task_1, Task_2, . . . , Task_n\}$.
\end{center}


Here \textit {Problem} – complex problem; Task\_i – particular task,
\textit{i} = 1, . . . , \textit{n}.

As an example, let’s consider the decomposition of a
complex problem – \textit{situational analysis} – on following
particular tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Task_{1}$ – identification of a situation;
    \item $Task_{2}$ – estimation of alternative decisions;
    \item $Task_{3}$ – prognosis of the resulting situation. 
\end{itemize}

\textit{Stage} 2. Specifying the requirements to fuzzy models
for each of particular tasks.

The \textit{following classification of requirements to intelligent models for particular tasks is offered:}
\begin{itemize}\textit{
\item {$R_{1}$} – subject of knowledge: \{R1,1 – about object of
management; {$R_{1,2}$} – about a management method;
{$R_{1,3}$} – about interrelation of events; {$R_{1,4}$} – about the
decision-maker “relation” to object of management;
{$R_{1,5}$} – about the decision-maker “relation” to a
management method\};
\item {$R_{2}$} – type of time analysis: \{{$R_{2,1}$} – statics; {$R_{2,2}$}
– short-term dynamics; {$R_{2,3}$} – long-term/complete
dynamics\};
\item {$R_{3}$} – uncertainty type: \{$R_{3,1}$ – the stochastic; $R_{3,2}$ –
not stochastic; $R_{3,3}$ – stochastic and not stochastic\};
\item {$R_{4}$} – method of knowledge acquisition: \{$R_{4,1}$ –
primary; $R_{4,2}$ – secondary\}.}
\end{itemize}
\par For each particular task $Task_{i}(i=1, . . . , n)$ one or
several possible groups of these requirements can be
determined.

\begin{center}
$Task_{i}, i = 1, . . . , n : \{G_{i,1}, G_{i,2}, . . . , G_{i,mi}\}$ 
\end{center}
Here $m_i$ – number of possible groups of requirements
for a task $Task_i$

The example of requirements to fuzzy models for
particular tasks ($Task_{1}$, $Task_{2}$ and $Task_{3}$) is presented in
Table 1.

Stage 3. Classification of intelligent models and concretization of their possibilities to meet the requirements
for particular tasks.

The following classification of fuzzy models depending on their purpose is offered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item universal fuzzy models (rule-based, relational, functional);
    \item task-oriented fuzzy models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item functional and relational estimation models;
    \item models of events (linguistic lotteries, event
trees, failure trees, Bayesian networks, game
models);
\item state models and management models (“stateaction” models, situational networks with the
direct/inverse method of model design, cognitive maps, Markovian and semi-Markovian
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

[3].

Stage 4. Specification of set of the intelligent models
that meets requirements for particular tasks.

“The covering tree” of complex problem is formed
by a set of corresponding fuzzy models on the basis of
Stages 2 and 3. The example of “the covering tree” for
a considered problem is presented in Fig. 1.

\textit{Stage 5.} Selection of a subset of the intelligent models
providing minimal “covering” of a complex problem.

Minimal “covering” of a complex problem is such a
subset of fuzzy models where even removal of one of the
models leads to impossibility of the problem solution.

The following subset of fuzzy models for a considered
example is selected:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fuzzy situational network with the direct method of
model design (basic model);
    \item fuzzy model “state-action” (supplementary model);
    \item linguistic lotteries (supplementary model).
\end{itemize}
\section{EXAMPLE OF THE COMPOSITIONAL
FUZZY MODEL FOR THE EFFICIENCY
ESTIMATION OF ENERGY- AND RESOURCE
SAVING}


Figure 2 shows the structure of the compositional
fuzzy model for the efficiency estimation of energy- and
resource saving, based on the proposed method [8].

The compositional fuzzy model consists of the sets of
the following models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fuzzy cognitive models for estimating the effects of
actions on the subsystems’ indicators (power supply,
heat and water supply);
    \item fuzzy rule-based models for efficiency estimating of
energy- and resource saving of subsystems: power
supply, heat and water supply;
    \item generalized fuzzy rule-based model for efficiency
estimating of energy- and resource saving of system
as a whole
\end{itemize}

The fuzzy cognitive models are affected by events
from groups of measures $A_{s_{j}} =\{a_{k_{j}}^{\small( s_{j} \small)}\}
, k_{j} = 1, . . . , K_{j} $,
corresponding to subsystems $\forall s_{j} \in S$. As a result,
the values of the output variables $p_{1}(s_{j})$ and $p_{2}(s_{j})$
of these models, which (together with indicators $p_{3}(s_{j})$
and $p_{4}(s_{j})$, do not depend on the impact of the events)
are fed to the inputs of fuzzy rule-based models for
efficiency estimating $e(s_{j} ), j = 1, . . . , J$ of energy- and
resource saving of subsystems. Then, these estimates are
aggregated into a generalized indicator $E(S)$ of energy
and resource efficiency of the entire system $S$ using
generalized fuzzy rule-based model.
\section{CONCLUSION}

The development trends of intelligent models are
generalized. The approach to systematization and classification of hybrid models is offered. Examples of
classification of known hybrid intelligent models related
to each considered approach to their hybridization are
given.

The proposed method of hybridization of intelligent
models is considered. This method consists of the following stages: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] decomposition of a complex problem into set of
particular tasks; 
    \item[(ii)] specifying the requirements to models for each of
particular tasks; 
    \item[(iii)] classification of intelligent models and concretization of their possibilities to meet the requirements
for particular tasks;
    \item[(iv)] specification of set of the intelligent models that
meets requirements for particular tasks;
    \item[(v)] selection of a subset of the intelligent models providing minimal “covering” of a complex problem.
